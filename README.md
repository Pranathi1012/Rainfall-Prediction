# Rainfall-Prediction
             The main objective of this project is to predict the rainfall using logistic regression. LG gives the best accuracy for the data which is collected by me through Kaggle. First the dataset is collected from the Kaggle and then import pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, sklearn. Then import the data and then data pre-processing should be done. At-last the predictions are done using the LG algorithm.
             
The project is done using python programming language and NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn as the libraries used to pre-process, visualize and train the models for prediction. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict the rainfall by analysing the weather data.

In this project using univariate and multivariate analysis we find the missing values and unique values in the dataset. Data modelling and feature scaling is done and finally predicting the results through LG.

Machine Learning algorithm used:
Logistic Regression
Accuracy achieved: 84%(Logistic Regression)
